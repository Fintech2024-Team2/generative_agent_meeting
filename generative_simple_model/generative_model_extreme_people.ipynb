He is a tall, gaunt man with a permanent, eerie grin stretched across his face, earning him his name. Rictus delights in telling gruesome tales and has a collection of bizarre artifacts that he claims are cursed. Despite his unsettling demeanor, he is oddly beloved by the locals for his morbid sense of humor and his skill in mixing potent brews.\",\n","    \"Mistress Thorn\": \"Mistress Thorn is a regal and enigmatic woman who is rumored to be a powerful sorceress. She rarely leaves her opulent manor on the edge of town, and when she does, it is often under the cover of night. She has a cold, commanding presence, and the townsfolk whisper that she can control the weather and summon spirits at will. No one knows her true motives, but she is both respected and feared by all who meet her.\",\n","    \"The Weaver\": \"Known only as The Weaver, this enigmatic figure is never seen in public. Instead, they communicate through cryptic messages left on tattered pieces of cloth found around town. Some say The Weaver is a ghost, others a spy, but everyone agrees that their influence is growing. The Weaver seems to know everyone's secrets and often predicts tragic events before they happen, leaving the town in a constant state of unease.\",\n","    \"Gretta Greenthumb\": \"Gretta is a wild-eyed herbalist with a deep connection to the natural world, but she is far from the gentle, nurturing type.

The townsfolk are wary of her, but they still seek her out when in need, though they never stay long in her presence.\",\n","    \"Carnifex the Butcher\": \"Carnifex is a towering, scarred orc who runs the local butcher shop. He claims to have reformed from a life of violence, but his brutal methods of carving meat suggest otherwise. Carnifex is known for his unnerving habit of whistling cheerful tunes while working, and some say his shop is haunted by the souls of those he’s slain in the past. Despite this, his meats are of exceptional quality, and the townsfolk begrudgingly keep him in business.\",\n","    \"Morgana the Seer\": \"Morgana is a blind, ancient woman who lives in a dilapidated hut on the outskirts of town. Though she cannot see, she claims to have visions of the past, present, and future. Her prophecies are often delivered in cryptic rhymes, and she has a disturbing habit of laughing at seemingly inappropriate moments. The townsfolk both revere and fear her, as her predictions, though often vague, have an unsettling tendency to come true.\",\n","    \"Whisper\": \"Whisper is a mysterious figure who is always shrouded in dark, flowing robes that completely hide their identity. No one knows Whisper’s true face, gender, or even if they are truly human. Whisper communicates only through hushed, barely audible words, as if speaking too loudly would bring doom upon the town. They are a master of secrets, often appearing when least expected to offer cryptic advice or warnings, leaving the townsfolk in a constant state of paranoia.\",\n","}\n","\n","for town_area in town_areas.keys():\n","  world_graph.add_node(town_area)\n","  world_graph.add_edge(town_area, town_area)\n","for town_area in town_areas.keys():\n","  world_graph.add_edge(town_area, \"Phandalin Town Square\")\n","locations = {}\n","for i in town_people.keys():\n","  locations[i] = \"Phandalin Town Square\"\n","\n","\n","memories = {}\n","for i in town_people.keys():\n","  memories[i] = []\n","plans = {}\n","for i in town_people.keys():\n","  plans[i] = []\n","\n","global_time = 8\n","def generate_description_of_area(x):\n","  text = \"It is \"+str(global_time)+\":00.
